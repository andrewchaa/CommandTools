Command tools
=============

It's a collection of handy command tools, I use day to day.


* Ntail


NTail
-------

Linux tail clone, written in C#. 

A few features it has over tail are

* colour-code warning and error messages to catch the reader's attention. Warning is in magenta and error in red.

A few features that are going to be added are

*
* clear: you can clear the screen so that you can new file change clearly
* a few more, probably
