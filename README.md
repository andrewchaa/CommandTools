NTail
=============

C# implementation of Linux' tail.

A few added features are

* colour-code warning and error messages to catch the reader's attention. Warning is in magenta and error in red.
* CTRL + N: New. Clear the console screen
* CTRL + M: Mark. The text will be in a different background colour, so that it's easy for you to spot the changes you are interested. One more CTRL + M will unmark the text.
* SPACE: Pause. It will pause text ouput. One more SPACE will unpause it.

I would welcome any feedback or suggestiongs!
